        "#Person1#: How do you like these dishes?\n#Person2#: Fine, they are colorful and tasty.\n#Person1#: Did you enjoy your dinner?\n#Person2#: Yes, I did. I have never tasted anything like this.\n#Person1#: Would you like some more rice?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. I'm full.\n#Person1#: Another piece of meat pie?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. I'm on diet.\n#Person1#: How about the dessert?\n#Person2#: Ice cream, please.",
        "#Person1#: Hi, Mr. Zhang. What's wrong? You don't look so happy. How was your date?\n#Person2#: I was turned down again. It's frustrating. I guess you'Ve got to teach me some skills.\n#Person1#: Me? I'm even less experienced than you are.\n#Person2#: At least you know what American women generally like in a man.\n#Person1#: Believe it or not, I guess American women like a man in good shape, which Chinese women may not care about so much. That's my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.\n#Person2#: American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, there aren't many chances.\n#Person1#: No, that's not true. I'Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese. But those Chinese look very strong and healthy. So if you exercise more often, I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls. How old is Jacky Chan? He's small and short. But I bet he can have any American woman he wants.\n#Person2#: You know, that's going to be a tremendous change for me. Because I never exercise.\n#Person1#: Why don't you try then? Even if it doesn't help you find an American girl, you could still have a stronger and healthier body. You won't lose anything by doing that.",

I prefer something lighter, yellow or pink.\n#Person1#: How about the pink one?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's nice. I'll take it.\n#Person1#: That's 12 dollars 50 cents then please.\n#Person2#: Here you are.",

I dare say it will be. \n#Person1#: It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed. \n#Person2#: No. I don't think that's possible. Some places are sure to be open. \n#Person1#: But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money. \n#Person2#: Mmm, you may be right. \n#Person1#: Do you think we'll need our overcoats? \n#Person2#: No. We couldn't possibly. \n#Person1#: Why not? \n#Person2#: It will be summer. So it will be hot. \n#Person1#: Is that very likely in England? \n#Person2#: Yes. It could happen. ",
        "#Person1#: Have you moved into your new house yet, Michael?\n#Person2#: We just moved in yesterday, actually.\n#Person1#: So, what do you think about the place?

I've got flowers in the front, and fruits, vegetables and a fish pond in the back.\n#Person1#: Is your house well-lit?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. Our windows let plenty of natural light in. They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house.\n#Person1#: How many rooms does your house have?\n#Person2#: Right now, there are three bedrooms, two barrooms, a kitchen, a sitting room, a dining room, and a living room.

What have you been doing lately?\n#Person2#: Oh, nothing much really. I went to Singapore to study for a period.\n#Person1#: Wow, that's great. What have you been studying?\n#Person2#: Natural language processing.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's hard. I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month.\n#Person2#: Really?

        "#Person1#: That is the most boring, typical gift in the world!\n#Person2#: I know. But this year I want to get him an interesting tie. Like this one.\n#Person1#: That's not exactly a conversation piece. It's so plain.\n#Person2#: It's perfect! It's a Dilbert tie!\n#Person1#: The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though. . .\n#Person2#: But watch this. . . it bends upwards, just like Dilbert's tie. There's a wire inside.\n#Person1#: A fly-away tie! What a riot!",

It looks very attractive.\n#Person1#: I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot.\n#Person2#: Tasty and tender! It must be one of the famous local dishes.\n#Person1#: Yes. It's a traditional dish.\n#Person2#: And it must be very particular in cooking.\n#Person1#: You are right, sir. To prepare it, a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown, and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts. That's why the dish has a bright colour.\n#Person2#: I see.\n#Person1#: Enjoy yourself, sir.",
        "#Person1#: I saw a beautiful fish in the market the other day, it was orange and blue. I'm thinking of buying some next Sunday.\n#Person2#: Where would you keep them?\n#Person1#: In that round bottle over there.\n#Person2#: It's a bit small, isn't it?\n#Person1#: So are the fish.\n#Person2#: I think you should get a tank if you want to keep fish.\n#Person1#: Really?\n#Person2#: Yes, you should never keep fish in a small round bottle. They don't get enough air. I suggest we go shopping together and look for a nice tank.\n#Person1#: That might be quite expensive.\n#Person2#: Check the prices before you buy one and you ought to put a few large rocks in the tank. Fish love swimming around the rocks and through holes in them.\n#Person1#: Is there anything else that I ought to get?\n#Person2#: Yes, you need to get some underwater plants, for one thing they keep the water clean, also they make the tank look much prettier.",
        "#Person1#: Wow, Is winter always this cold in Taiwan?\n#Person2#: Not really. It's much warmer usually. Your are not used to cold weather?\n#Person1#: No, I am from south California.

        "#Person1#: This is awful! It's like drinking saltwater! It's like drowning in the ocean!\n#Person2#: Don't be so dramatic. You're such a baby. Now sit down and finish your soup.\n#Person1#: OK, OK.\n#Person2#: And when we get back from the doctor's, you'll gargle again.\n#Person1#: Maybe I'll run away first.\n#Person2#: Well, the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen, and their soup isn't as tasty as mine!",

Why didn't you meet me there? \n#Person1#: I thought we were supposed to meet here. \n#Person2#: Don't you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn't make sense to meet at the apartment. \n#Person1#: I'm sorry. We must have misunderstood each other. \n#Person2#: Why don't you try to be clearer about your intentions? \n#Person1#: You're right. I am sorry. Let's go and watch the movie. \n#Person2#: It's okay. I don't want to go now. We've already missed ten minutes of the movie. I don't want to see a movie without watching the beginning. ",

I think you see more traveling by train.\n#Person1#: So which form of transport do you prefer to use?\n#Person2#: I prefer going by train, even though it costs more.\n#Person1#: Ok, then we'll go by train. I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets?\n#Person2#: The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets, because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles.\n#Person1#: We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive.",

I'm terribly sorry.\n#Person2#: It sucks. But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience.\n#Person1#: He's the only one of the several to decide this.\n#Person2#: How am I going to face the fellows in our office? They thought I would be promoted. They must be waiting for my good news.\n#Person1#: I don't think the thing can be that serious. You should face the result. Besides, I don't think the position is the best for you.\n#Person2#: But I lost the chance.\n#Person1#: Keep working hard, and then you will get another chance of promotion someday.",

Registering for classes is not something you want to miss.\n#Person1#: What classes do you think are still open?\n#Person2#: Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology.\n#Person1#: That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.\n#Person2#: I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.\n#Person1#: He does that?\n#Person2#: I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class.\n#Person1#: That makes sense.
