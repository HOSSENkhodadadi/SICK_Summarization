        "#Person1#: Yes. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. You see, I've bought this personal stereo at your shop 3 days ago. And I'm afraid it hasn't really matched up to what I was told about.\n#Person1#: I see, what exactly is the matter?\n#Person2#: Well, first of all, there is this large scratch across the front of it.\n#Person1#: But you should have noticed that when you bought it.\n#Person2#: But it was in the box and all sealed up.\n#Person1#: Well. I'm sorry, but it really is your responsibility to check the goods when you buy them. How are we to know that it wasn't you who made the scratch?\n#Person2#: But that's ridiculous. But anyway, it's not the most important thing. I really am not happy about this other thing.\n#Person1#: And what is that?\n#Person2#: Look. It says here that the noise from it should be undetectable by other people.\n#Person1#: Yes, that's right.\n#Person2#: But people can hear it, and it's really embarrassing on the bus and underground.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm sorry, but it must be the way you are wearing the headphones.\n#Person2#: Look. I know how to put earphones in my ears. Thank you very much. But what I want to know is, what you are going to do about it at all?\n#Person1#: Well, I suppose we could exchange it for another model, if you really aren't happy with it.\n#Person2#: No, I certainly am not.\n#Person1#: Well, if I could just have the receipt.\n#Person2#: Oh yes. Well, there is a slight problem about the receipt.",
        "#Person1#: Hello?\n#Person2#: Good morning, Nathaniel. This is Leah calling from the International Student Office.\n#Person1#: Good morning.\n#Person2#: The reason I'm calling is because Ms. Collins will not be able to call you back until next week.\n#Person1#: Oh. I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday.\n#Person2#: She's terribly sorry about that. She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week. She hopes you understand.\n#Person1#: Is there someone else I can talk to?\n#Person2#: She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today. When are you free today?\n#Person1#: Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me.\n#Person2#: Mr. Liu is available at 2:15 today. Will that work for you?\n#Person1#: I'd prefer to speak with Ms. Fonda.\n#Person2#: I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon. She has an opening at 11:30 this morning. Will that work for you?\n#Person1#: that will be fine.\n#Person2#: Ok, we'll be expecting you at 11:30. See you then.",
        "#Person1#: Hi, Tony. You look unhappy. What's wrong?\n#Person2#: Oh, Steven, I made a big mistake.\n#Person1#: What happened?\n#Person2#: I really wish I hadn't done it.\n#Person1#: What on earth are you talking about?\n#Person2#: I got caught cheating. I feel so ashamed. The teacher saw me and told me I failed.\n#Person1#: What were you thinking?\n#Person2#: You know my father. If I fail, he'll kill me. I have to do well.\n#Person1#: But what you should do is study hard.\n#Person2#: I know. . . I know. . . it's all my fault. I feel awful that I didn't study, and I cheated, and I got caught.\n#Person1#: So long as you learn from your mistakes.",
        "#Person1#: Vet, can you tell us what you usually do to deal with stress and depression?\n#Person2#: I eat a cucumber and go to bed. I figure it's a healthy alternative to chocolate.\n#Person1#: Do you ever feel that having a baby has stopped you from your goals or dreams?\n#Person2#: I always wanted to be a cheerleader, and that won't happen, I also miss out on a lot of freedom. No one makes me come home on time, and I probably wouldn't normally, but I now have a responsibility to my baby.\n#Person1#: What is your favorite part of having a daughter?\n#Person2#: It is so hard to narrow it down to one thing. I love the way she looks at me and admires me. She lets me feel so much love. She is innocent and pure. The best part of being with her is watching her go through every stage knowing there is somebody who loves her.\n#Person1#: What are your plans for the future?\n#Person2#: I am going to be a lawyer. Down the road, I hope to move out of Utah.\n#Person1#: What are some of your future goals and dreams?\n#Person2#: I want to start small. First and foremost, I am looking forward to graduating from high school. I eventually want to get married. Having a father figure in my baby's life is important to me because I missed out on that. I want to start modeling again, and I hope to keep up with my dancing and singing. It is also important to keep family traditions for me and my baby.\n#Person1#: What is your favorite quote?\n#Person2#: What happens in the dark will come out in the light. There is nothing that you can try to hide without it coming out sometime. It is important not to hide anything from yourself or anybody else.\n#Person1#: What advice would you give teens?\n#Person2#: Take things slow, and be a kid as long as you possibly can. Don't expect everything to be perfect, and make decisions for yourself. Live life to the fullest. Love yourself first, and everything else will fall into place.",
        "#Person1#: Honey, of course I forgive you! I love you so much! I've really missed you. I was wrong to get upset over nothing. \n#Person2#: I'm sorry I haven't called or anything, but right after you decided you wanted a break, I was called up north to put out some major forest fires! I was in the middle of nowhere, working day and night, trying to prevent the blaze from spreading! It was pretty intense. \n#Person1#: Oh, honey, I'm glad you're okay! But I have some exciting news. . . I think I'm pregnant! \n#Person2#: Really? Wow, that's amazing! This is great news! I've always wanted to be a father! We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning! \n#Person3#: We have your test results back and, indeed, you are pregnant. Let's see here. . . everything seems to be in order. Your approximate due date is October twenty-seventh two thousand and nine, so that means that the baby was conceived on February third, two thousand and nine. \n#Person2#: Are you sure? Are these things accurate? \n#Person3#: Well, yes sir, they are. \n#Person1#: What's wrong? Why are you asking these questions? \n#Person2#: This baby isn't mine! I was away the first week of February at a training seminar! \n#Person1#: I. . . I. . . no, it can't be. . . ",
        "#Person1#: Hello\n#Person2#: Hi Angela, it's Dan.\n#Person1#: Hi Dan. How are you?\n#Person2#: Good.\n#Person1#: I called you yesterday. Did you get my message?\n#Person2#: Yes, I was taking a shower when you called. I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but I think your phone was off.\n#Person1#: No problem. I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week. You're still coming to the wedding with me, right?\n#Person2#: Oh, is that next week?\n#Person1#: Yes. Did you forget?\n#Person2#: No, of course not. I already bought them a present.\n#Person1#: That's good. I want to invite Megan also. Next time you see her, can you tell her for me.\n#Person2#: Sure. Does she know your friend?\n#Person1#: Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that. I'm not exactly sure how they know each other.\n#Person2#: Are we all going to drive together?\n#Person1#: Yes. I'll pick you up first, and then we'll go get Megan.",
        "#Person1#: Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out.\n#Person2#: The exact time? Let me think. You know, it happened at night.\n#Person1#: But we need the exact time. What time?\n#Person2#: Oh, I remember. It was about 10 o'clock. When I was about to go to bed, suddenly I heard help outside.",
        "#Person1#: Right Rebecca. Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was. . .\n#Person2#: For a local paper in York called the York Herald. Actually, I started with them as an intern in the beginning. I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world, and this seemed like a good first step.\n#Person1#: Certainly. And after your internship?\n#Person2#: They seemed impressed, and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter. I ended up staying two years there actually. I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper. I really enjoyed it there, and it really helped me build my skills.\n#Person1#: Yes I see. But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. My husband and I moved to London, and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London.\n#Person1#: The London Weekly right?\n#Person2#: Yes, in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.",
        "#Person1#: I am happy I started carrying the credit card that the bank gave us.\n#Person2#: Why is that, Kate? Did you use it to buy something?\n#Person1#: I surely did. On my way home I stopped at the store to buy some beef for dinner because I didn't have any cash with me.\n#Person2#: And they permitted you to pay with the card?\n#Person1#: Yes. They didn't even ask me to give the ID.\n#Person2#: You have to be careful. If you lose them and someone finds them, the bank will charge you for what you buy.\n#Person1#: How much has the bank allowed us to spend with the card?\n#Person2#: Fifteen hundred dollars. The bank encourages us to use the card, but they will also require us to pay them back.\n#Person1#: You are right, Henry. I'll remember that. But the card surely makes it easy to spend money.",
        "#Person1#: How long does it take to get to downtown from here?\n#Person2#: It is 15 minutes ' drive.\n#Person1#: What companies do we have in our neighborhood?\n#Person2#: Mitsubishi, HP, IBM and many other famous corporations.\n#Person1#: Does the 7th floor belong to our company too?\n#Person2#: Yes, our company has two floors, the 6th and 7th floor in this building.\n#Person1#: It ' s such a large firm. Do we have our own staff restaurant?\n#Person2#: Yes, at the end of the hall.",
        "#Person1#: Well, you must be happy, Nathan you're almost ready to go to Chicago for your practice. We're sure going to miss you around here.\n#Person2#: I'll miss you too, mom. But yeah, I'm excited about my summer. And don't be too sad. I'll be back in a few months, in time for the first day of school. By winter break, you'll hardly remember I was even gone.\n#Person1#: So how do you think you'll do in the big city? Are you worried about working for a big newspaper like the Chicago Tribune?\n#Person2#: Not really. I'm not afraid of hard work and I know how to organize my day. I think I'll do a good job.\n#Person1#: But doing for practice isn't just for the company to profit, is it? It's also for you to get experience. Do you even know what you'll be doing?\n#Person2#: I'm not worried about that. I've got a lot of natural curiosity. And I'm very social, I'm sure I'll learn from all the other people there.\n#Person1#: What if they stick you in some backroom by yourself just copying papers or taking out the trash?\n#Person2#: I don't think that will happen. They asked for someone who was good at editing, organizing computer files and keeping track of deadlines. And I already know who I'll be working with, one of their regular writers.\n#Person1#: That's good, so you will probably get some on the job training. This is such a great opportunity for you.",
        "#Person1#: Wow, there are so many lanterns to appreciate. Now, I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival. It deserves its name.\n#Person2#: Yeah. People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances.\n#Person1#: What are they doing over there? People keep on gathering there.\n#Person2#: Did you notice the characters on the lanterns?\n#Person1#: Sure. But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters. What do they say?\n#Person2#: They are puzzles. It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival.\n#Person1#: Very interesting. But I'm afraid we'd better do something else. Hey, look! There is a huge lantern there. Let's get close to it.\n#Person2#: It's really eye-catching. It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life.\n#Person1#: Really? Then I'm really lucky. Oh, it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth.\n#Person2#: Very impressive. It's made of glass which makes it even brighter.\n#Person1#: There are many Chinese characters on its body, too. What are they about? Puzzles?\n#Person2#: Let me have a look. Oh, no. They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene.",
        "#Person1#: Excuse me, sir. What would you like to eat, Chinese food or western food?\n#Person2#: I'd like to have Chinese food.\n#Person1#: Are you going to have this set course or have dinner in the dining room?\n#Person2#: Right here, please.\n#Person1#: Please put down the table in front of you.

        "#Person1#: Have you ever thought of moving, Sarah?\n#Person2#: We thought about it, but my husband and I can't afford it right now.\n#Person1#: Buying a house near our company can be expensive, but there are ways to find cheaper houses.\n#Person2#: Like what?\n#Person1#: Well, you can buy a house far away from the city center. You would definitely save money that way.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea.\n#Person1#: My sister in law and her husband just bought a house that way. And they're pretty satisfied with it.\n#Person2#: Is the house in poor condition?\n#Person1#: Not at all, the woman who owned it bought it from her friend and took good care of it. But when she died she had no family left and no will, so the government had to sell it for her.\n#Person2#: Was it a very old house?\n#Person1#: Yes, it was about 50 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing but it didn't take a lot of money or time.\n#Person2#: Is it in a good location?\n#Person1#: The area can be a bit rough in the evening but the neighbors watch out for each other so it's OK.",

How can an indiscretion last two months? I mean, you two have been married for two years! How can he do that to you?\n#Person2#: I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn't tell me the truth or end the relationship with her.\n#Person1#: Good. I totally agree with what you did.",
        "#Person1#: Excuse me, Sir, do you know what time it is?\n#Person2#: Oh, it's almost eleven twenty.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: You're welcome. The rain is quite heavy, isn't it?\n#Person1#: Yeah. I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today.\n#Person2#: I have one. We could share it. Which way are you going?\n#Person1#: Oh, that's very kind of you. I am going to the Garden Hotel.\n#Person2#: I am going there, too. We can walk together.\n#Person1#: Sure.",

Err... It's five grams over weigh, Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter?\n#Person2#: I want it registered. How much is it then?\n#Person1#: Registration plus overnight... err... seven dollars in all.\n#Person2#: Here's a 10 - dollar bill.\n#Person1#: Now, your receipt, and the change.\n#Person2#: Thanks. Good-bye.",
        "#Person1#: I don't know what I'm going to do! It's going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job! \n#Person2#: Don't worry. I don't think you're going to lose your job over one mistake. \n#Person1#: It was a rather big mistake. When you work as an investment adviser, one small mistake can cost the company millions. \n#Person2#: But it wasn't just you who was involved, right? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do. \n#Person1#: That's true, but my supervisor is very dishonest. There's no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth. I'm sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault, and there's nothing I can do about that. My boss won't believe me if I tell him the truth. \n#Person2#: Let's think realistically about what might happen. How much money do you have in your savings? \n#Person1#: I have enough to live off of for about 3 months. But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living! I'd rather invest my money somehow. \n#Person2#: Well, you can't have everything. Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job. When is your contract up on your apartment? \n#Person1#: Next month. So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year. \n#Person2#: Well, that's good. If you lose your job, you can just move in with me until you find another job. That will save you plenty of money. \n#Person1#: That's very generous of you. I guess that would work. \n#Person2#: If you lose your job, you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy. If you live frugally, you'll save plenty of money. \n#Person1#: I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy. Maybe losing my job would be a good thing! ",
        "#Person1#: do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11?\n#Person2#: yes, I was in my apartment in Beijing. Where were you?\n#Person1#: I was at home with my parents in New York City.\n#Person2#: really? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers?\n#Person1#: I didn't see the crash itself, but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents' apartment building.\n#Person2#: that must have been horrible. Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on?\n#Person1#: no, we decided to stay in our apartment. With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt, many people had no choice but to walk home. It was utter chaos.\n#Person2#: did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center?\n#Person1#: yes, my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers.\n#Person2#: did he survive?\n#Person1#: unfortunately, he wasn't able to evacuate in time. He ended up dying in the tower.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family.\n#Person1#: it was. The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own.\n#Person2#: terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life.",
        "#Person1#: There you are, Ben. The information about the evening classes I sent off for has arrived. Right, here are the general courses.\n#Person2#: Flower arranging. That's a real course? Why would someone want to do that?\n#Person1#: You sit in front of the TV watching baseball for 3 hours every Saturday. And many people would find that boring, too.\n#Person2#: OK, relax. Let's see what else.\n#Person1#: Photography. That looks interesting. It started last week, but I don't think that would be a problem.\n#Person2#: But look at the price. $280 is too much for me. I wonder why it's so expensive. I don't think I can afford it. But, hey, at least it's $40 cheaper than the Italian wine course. Look at that. $400 web design for beginners. It's pretty cheap. What do you think?\n#Person1#: I don't want to see a computer in the evening too.\n#Person2#: Hey, look. How about Indian cooking? Starts this week. A little bit expensive.\n#Person1#: $190. You know how much I love Indian food. I'll call him tomorrow to see if there are still spaces available.\n#Person2#: I'll call them right away.\n#Person1#: There won't be anyone there now. We'll try in the morning.\n#Person2#: This will be great. We can have our own Indian dinner parties.",

        "#Person1#: Catherine, have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation?\n#Person2#: Yes, I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name.\n#Person1#: It's very thought-provoking, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Exactly. It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal.\n#Person1#: So what do you think of the American fast food culture?\n#Person2#: I think America really deserves the name of fast food nation - as people can find McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States.\n#Person1#: And everyone knows that Americans'favorite food is the hamburger, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Sure. You see, Tom, fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience. People just don't care whether it is healthy or not.\n#Person1#: But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants. .\n#Person2#: What are they?\n#Person1#: Such as fat-free milk, whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich.\n#Person2#: They're much better\n#Person1#: But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived.\n#Person2#: That's the point. People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have an on-the-go meal.\n#Person1#: Well, Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods.\n#Person2#: I suppose so.",

No more chips, no more soda, no more fried food.\n#Person2#: I've heard this one before.\n#Person1#: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time!\n#Person2#: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.\n#Person1#: Thanks, honey, that was a great meal. I'm stuffed.

        "#Person1#: Hey, Tom, did you enjoy your lunch?\n#Person2#: Oh, don't mention it. It was terrible.\n#Person1#: What'the matter?\n#Person2#: The food station was as crowded as usual. I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich, and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone.\n#Person1#: I see. You simply can't blame the server for this.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know. Fast food is so popular in this district.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: Anyway, how was your such, Catherine?\n#Person1#: It was good. I brough lunch from home today.\n#Person2#: You did? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America.\n#Person1#: Well, I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy.\n#Person2#: I guess you're right. More often than not, people go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, but generally speaking, they are high in calories, salt and fat.\n#Person1#: Yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle, don't you?\n#Person2#: You bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America.\n#Person1#: Well, actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places.\n#Person2#: Seriously?\n#Person1#: Yeah, it's hard to believe but true.",

Do I need it?\n#Person2#: Yes, you need it. My sister might call you to tell us how the kids are doing. Maybe it's in the car.\n#Person1#: I remember where it is. I left it in the bakery where we ate breakfast.\n#Person2#: OK, well, I need to call my sister to tell her you lost your phone. Then I'll call the bakery. If the bakery is still open, maybe we can pick it up before we go to the wedding. Please keep your phone in your pocket next time.",
        "#Person1#: OK, that's a cut. Let's start from the beginning everyone.\n#Person2#: What was the problem that time?\n#Person1#: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you anymore, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\n#Person2#: But Jason and Laura had been together for 3 years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\n#Person1#: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\n#Person2#: I'm not so sure about that.\n#Person1#: Let's try it my way and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right we can try something else.",
        "#Person1#: I don't know if you've heard of it, Peter, but some of us are thinking of going to Xi'an in the summer. I don't know if you'd like to come with us.\n#Person2#: Well, that's very kind of you, Jane, but when are you thinking of going?\n#Person1#: Oh, some time in July. Around the 16th, I think.\n#Person2#: I see. And for how long? About two weeks?\n#Person1#: Well, we were going to but now one or two of the other students say they don't have enough money, so it'll just be a week. You're interested, then?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes, very much. Do you know how much it's going to cost?\n#Person1#: Yes, about 2000 yuan altogether.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's good. Is everybody going?\n#Person1#: Yes, most of them, not Monica, of course. She's off to Harbin again.\n#Person2#: Lucky thing! It must be nice to have parents living in the north.\n#Person1#: Yes, it must. But if you had a lot of money, Peter, where would you like to go for a holiday?\n#Person2#: Oh, I'd probably go to Xinjiang, or Tibet maybe. Somewhere far away, anyway. And you?\n#Person1#: I don't know really. Perhaps the southwest.\n#Person2#: Yes, that would be great."
