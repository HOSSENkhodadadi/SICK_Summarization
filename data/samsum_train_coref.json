Apart from anything else the Brexit deal? worse than simply taking a second vote and hopefully being able to withdraw from Article 50 notice.\r\nStephanie: Can we even withdraw now?\r\nFred: Apparently we even do withdraw nowThere are some opinions that say not, but in reality withdraw now be a big relief to the other countries.\r\nFred: The alternative, having no deal at all, is not only risky for we even but could cause big trouble to the rest of the states and of course there are quite big issues in the Eurozone already. This could tip over a very big landslide.\r\nStephanie: So you think we even get a better deal if we even out?\r\nFred: Right now the optimal strategy would be to stay inside the EU, forget about leaving as we even not know the hurdles that would be placed by the powers that be. we even to work today? other Eurosceptic countries like Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and the other ex-Warsaw Pact countries.\r\nStephanie: To do what?\r\nFred: To change the EU, what we actually want the EU, be. To radically alter the EU, that the EU, what we actually the EU, going to be.\r\nStephanie: Can change the done?\r\nFred: We see that the Germans have had enough of Merkel. When Merkel. , Macron also goes. It wouldn't take more than one of those bigger countries going the way of Italy,or a few more of the secondary states like Holland and Denmark, from the western side, to start a programme of deep change.\r\nStephanie: Makes sense. IN the end we all need to have some kind of co-operation in Europe.\r\nFred: Every Brexiteer you think to actually wants A European Union, \r\nStephanie: Every Brexiteer I don't want the EU, \r\nFred: But is there any chance that there will be a second vote.\r\nStephanie: May has said no, but May has be finished in a week from now. If there is a General Election and all the Conservatives stand on a revote platform with UKIP and Labour saying no re-vote, then all the Conservatives stand well win. Then all the Conservatives stand have to offer a re-vote.\r\nFred: What if we even end up staying in but other countries start defaulting and leaving we even up the bills which was going to maybe happen to France and Germany?\r\nStephanie: That's the downside risk. Certainly if we even ever going to leave, the time to do leave, now, or stay and fight for a different kind of Union which might not need countries to go crashing out of it that way.\r\nFred: you think n't know if you will every find a format that 30 countries will be able to agree on.\r\n",
