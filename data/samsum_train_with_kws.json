I can imagine how much they appreciate Lawrie's work for them.\r\nAnnie: He's been even given a rise and there's an open offer for taking up some managerial position but he keeps turning them down. He says he is just a coder, not a manago.\r\nDora: But a coder with Gates Cambridge Scholarship!\r\nAnnie: True enough but he is right in saying that any managerial position but mean giving up his coding genius. He is not very modest, I know.\r\nDora: From what I hear he has every reason not to be. And as long as he is happy with his work, everything's fine, I guess.\r\nAnnie: So it is. Anyway, now they are all in Genoa. Lawrie delivering speeches, Aga breast-feeding, Adam getting bored to tears. Family life of sorts!\r\nDora: And not a bad one, I'd say.\r\nAnnie: I'm grateful for it. I'll get you new pics when she send some.\r\nDora: Ta!",

Did you stay for the night?\r\nSue: No, she begged us not to come! We set everything up, decs, drinks etc, nice buffet, but then we made ourselves scarce, we only live on the next street, you see. We decided to pop back in a few hours. That was very naive of us, to be honest!\r\nLouise: I'm guessing things didn't actually go smoothly!\r\nSue: Understatement of the year! Pete went back round about 11.00 and there was utter carnage! There was vomit and spilled drinks everywhere, the front window had been smashed, the bathroom door had come off it's hinges and the mother and toddler toys and books were ripped and strewn about all over the place.

About 8 of her friends were sleeping at our house, so they all crashed back there sheepishly.\r\nLouise: Yes, but next day, she must have apologised to you.\r\nSue: She did not! In fact, around 6 of the group came back to the Hall to help clean up, but Lara refused to get out of bed!\r\nLouise: I can't believe she acted so selfishly! \r\nSue: We've made her pay for the damage out of her part time job at the vets and also refused to pay for one of her holidays. \r\nLouise: Yes, you did right!

And I mean what I said in my airbnb review: you two are the best and most memorable guests we have ever had in our Casa Leo.\r\nDanny: We surely don't deserve so much praise :$ :$ :$\r\nLeon: Thank you ever so much for your kind and generous write-up for airbnb!\r\nDanny: You are doing a tremendously good job. Keep it up!\r\nLeon: How is your stay in Trinidad? Have you found good accommodation?\r\nDanny: Much to our shame I have to admit that we decided to stay in Las Cuevas, a state-run hotel. And that for a simple reason that airbnb doesn't list anything sensible and we didn't want to risk walking around the town dragging our suitcases and ask around for a room to rent. This hotel is just an easy option for us. It is quite OK, a bit too expensive, but in fact quite comfortable.\r\nLeon: I know the place. They have been in operation for nearly 60 years!\r\nDanny: Yes, we know. It was built as a motel for American tourist touring Cuba by car. But the politics had a different plan for them. Yet they seem to be doing fine with package tours.\r\nLeon: And organizing conferences and similar things. They are quite famous for it. I hope their food is alright for you.\r\nDanny: It's only breakfast as we prefer to eat in town. Every day a new place! Trinidad is absolutely fantastic for food with its choice of nearly a 100 restaurants. Pity so many of them are definitely too expensive for us. They are so beautiful!\r\nLeon: Sorry to hear that. But a fancy interior doesn't mean necessarily good food, does it?\r\nDanny: Not at all. We are absolutely happy with the place we've visited so far. The food was always excellent and the decor interesting. Very atmospheric places!\r\nLeon: Glad to hear it. I wish you only good experiences for the rest of your stay in Cuba.\r\nDanny: Thank you Leon!\r\nLeon: Pleasure.",

A small mountain range, up to 1500 m, in western France, just across the border from us.\r\nDoris: Am with a lady friend of mine, German. A bit of hiking in the area but staying in one place. She's got her big dog with her and the beast is just divine.\r\nTress: Aren't you so lucky to be able to walk as women alone in parts of Europe? This is unheard of here.\r\nDoris: This freedom of movement, also as a woman alone, driving or walking, city or countryside, this is a measure of a quality of life I take for granted in Europe. As much as I love being in ZA, I find it so difficult to cope with such restrictions. I love ZA dearly but I couldn't live there.\r\nTress: I assure you I hate it as much as you do but it's part and parcel of my existence, so I take THIS for granted.\r\nDoris: Sure enough. When over there, I accept it too and adjust accordingly but in the back of my mind there's this feeling of discomfort.\r\nTress: What's your accommodation like? I've never been to France even.\r\nDoris: Oh it's very very untypical. Here the link:\r\nDoris: A group of Dutch who bought a huge piece of land and live off it. And of paying guests! Everything fanatically organic, environmentally friendly and sustainable. No mobile phones, no cigarettes, no non-biodegradable products...\r\nTress: Sounds a tough regime! Did they have a look into your travel bag? ;)\r\nDoris: That's it! It's all based on trust. They ask you not to and trust you follow suit. You know they have a shop here, as we're miles away in the sticks, open 24 hrs, with food produce, cosmetics, preserves, postcards and that stuff. And it has an open till! You just take what you need and leave the money in the till.\r\nTress: No!!! Can you imagine anything like that in Khayelitsha?!\r\nDoris: May be more in Khayelitsha that in a mixed race area?\r\nTress: Nowhere in this wretched country. Never.\r\nTress: Look what's been happening here. It's a clip from our local paper: <file_photo>\r\nDoris: Oh no! Horrible HORRIBLE\r\nTress: Our daily news... So enjoy your European paradise Doris!\r\nDoris: It rams it home how lucky we are here. Travelling freely from country to country, meeting freely whoever and wherever. No border controls. \r\nTress: But different languages! I found it so confusing when we flew from England to Amsterdam, then on to Frankfurt and to Rome in the end.\r\nDoris: But everyone speaks English.

        "Stephanie: What do you think of what's happening in the UK Parliament today?\r\nFred: You mean the resignations of four high-ranking ministers over the Brexit deal?\r\nStephanie: Yes.\r\nFred: Well, I don't think this deal is going to get signed. Apart from anything else it is worse than simply taking a second vote and hopefully being able to withdraw from Article 50 notice.\r\nStephanie: Can we even withdraw now?\r\nFred: Apparently we can do that. There are some opinions that say not, but in reality it would be a big relief to the other countries. \r\nFred: The alternative, having no deal at all, is not only risky for the UK, but could cause big trouble to the rest of the states and of course there are quite big issues in the Eurozone already. This could tip over a very big landslide.\r\nStephanie: So you think we could get a better deal if we hold out?\r\nFred: Right now the optimal strategy would be to stay inside the EU, forget about leaving as we did not know the hurdles that would be placed by the powers that be. We need to work today with other Eurosceptic countries like Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and the other ex-Warsaw Pact countries.\r\nStephanie: To do what?\r\nFred: To change the EU into what we actually want it to be. To radically alter it so that it becomes what we hoped it was going to be.\r\nStephanie: Can that be done?\r\nFred: We see that the Germans have had enough of Merkel. When she goes, Macron also goes. It wouldn't take more than one of those bigger countries going the way of Italy, or a few more of the secondary states like Holland and Denmark, from the western side, to start a programme of deep change.\r\nStephanie: Makes sense. IN the end we all need to have some kind of co-operation in Europe.\r\nFred: Every Brexiteer I spoke to actually wants A European Union, they just don't want THIS European Union.\r\nStephanie: But is there any chance that there will be a second vote.\r\nFred: May has said no, but May could be finished in a week from now. If there is a General Election and all the Conservatives stand on a revote platform with UKIP and Labour saying no re-vote, then the Tories may well win. Then they would have to offer a re-vote.\r\nStephanie: What if we then end up staying in but other countries start defaulting and leaving us picking up the bills which was going to maybe happen to France and Germany?\r\nFred: That's the downside risk. Certainly if we are ever going to leave, the time to do it is now, or stay and fight for a different kind of Union which might not need countries to go crashing out of it that way. \r\nStephanie: I don't know if you will every find a format that 30 countries will be able to agree on. \r\nFred: Either you have to make it so that there is really not that much that they have to agree on, or you make everything so harmonised that it is really one country and everyone is unhappy with something. Where we are now is stuck in the middle, trying to agree and enforce too much, but still with options for countries to do things differently and to look after themselves. We haven't managed to deliver the European dream.",

And I think a friend of theirs or something, they must know each other well, since he accepted their apples and they didn't have any official certificate or anything.\r\nSamantha: That's an idea. Have you got their phone number? Or maybe could you ask them about that organic juice producer? You know Oli better than I.\r\nSoph: I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you!

A rib?\r\nBrenda: No, then I'd be howling with pain. It's just the impact of the fall that has, I don't know, damaged the tissue. Whatever I have here. Fat I suppose. It has to heal by itself.\r\nAndy: Can you breath normally?\r\nBrenda: Yes. I can't take a deep breath though.\r\nAndy: Can you touch your bruised side? Is it swollen? Red?\r\nBrenda: I can touch it, not press of course, but stroke. No, it isn't swollen. The skin is as usual, no discolouration. But this will come later, I suppose.\r\nAndy: Not necessarily. It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.\r\nAndy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?\r\nBrenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...\r\nAndy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.\r\nBrenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning. Fucking hell! I can hardly pull myself up.\r\nAndy: If I were you, I would go and see the doc first thing in the morning.\r\nBrenda: And he'll send me to have an x-ray. I can't bear the thought of driving or even walking.\r\nAndy: Well, he can come to your place and you'll be driven to hospital in an ambulance.\r\nBrenda: You stop scaring the shit out of me! I am not that invalid. It's just bloody painful but I think I'm in one piece.\r\nAndy: I don't know Brenda. One shouldn't take it too light those falls. You may still be in a state of shock and are underrating your condition. Will you phone me first thing in the morning please? Still from bed? Luise is gone by 7:30, so you won't be waking anyone up.\r\nBrenda: OK brother. I will give you a call. Of course if I'm still alive.\r\nAndy: Sister!! Anyway I wish you a good night's sleep. Have a good rest!\r\nBrenda: Thanks bro. Sleep tight too. \r\nBrenda: And don't worry about me.",

So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!\r\nTessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?\r\nHarry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.\r\nTessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?\r\nHarry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.\r\nTessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL\r\nHarry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?\r\nTessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?\r\nHarry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.\r\nTessy: Smashing! Where to?\r\nHarry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.\r\nTessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?\r\nHarry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.\r\nTessy: Apart from royals in Kitzb\u00fchel :)) \r\nHarry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.\r\nTessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!\r\nHarry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.\r\nTessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)\r\nHarry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.\r\nTessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.\r\nHarry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.\r\nTessy: STB you are.\r\nHarry: What the hell is STB?\r\nTessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt.

        "Mash: Hi Gorgeous! And? What is your news? Are you getting much work these days?\r\nGina: Hi there! Can't complain. Just enough commissions to keep me busy without overworking. Enough money too. And you?\r\nMash: I still work about 12-15 hours a week, which with my rental means that I am not dipping into my savings too much.\r\nGina: Sounds good. Is this journal Rose was an editor of still around?\r\nMash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year\u2019s editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.\r\nGina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?\r\nMash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well. Rose's granddaughter will be graduating from college this summer. You met her, remember?\r\nGina: Tina?\r\nMash: Tilla. A short for some name but can't remember.\r\nGina: Always wanted to ask you: how old is Rose?\r\nMash: Not sure. My age? Must be older as she's bound to be getting her pension by now.\r\nGina: Has she retired yet?!\r\nMash: So I hear. ALTA secretary told me the other day.\r\nGina: And you, old man?\r\nMash: I get my state pension in 2021. But not having paid much into my pension plan I can't expect it entirely to support me.\r\nGina: And the estate? The rents?\r\nMash: That will do, though I'd have to cut on booze\r\nMash: D\u2011':\r\nMash: The smallholding is looking fairly neat these days (mainly due to Hellie). So I don\u2019t work too hard there, but over the course of a year, I probably spend 4-5 hours a week working on it. Through butcher problems, we kept our pigs for a month longer than we expected this year, and in that time they grew by about 15-20 kilos each!. So my freezers are full to overflowing.\r\nGina: Pork is not good for you, they say. Especially for older folks.\r\nMash: We have decided to give the pigs a rest next year, since we should have plenty of meat. I really don't care if it's healthy or not as long as it tastes good.\r\nGina: Good old Mash!\r\nMash: It's me!\r\nGina: How grand to hear your news! \r\nMash: You must come and visit me again.\r\nGina: We'll think about it!\r\nMash: :)",

Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone.\r\nWilliam: <file_photo>\r\nWilliam: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep and are looking forward to do some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan.\r\nHelen: A big hello to you both, bold and undaunted travellers! Thanks for the info, we thought you'd got stuck in some ritzy place on the way from Cancun. :-))\r\nWilliam: No ritzy places on the way, rather rotten places and even worse signposting. We'd intended to take a country road to avoid paying the motorway toll but somehow ended up on their autov\u00eda de peaje anyway.\r\nHelen: How much?\r\nWilliam: 12. Bastards!\r\nHelen: You'll get over it. And how much do you pay for this sweet little house in Caucel?\r\nWilliam: Only 45 a night plus some fees but it's on the western side of the city, that is the opposite direction to most of such attractions as Maya temples and haciendas. Also far from the ocean coast. Praised be the angel who told me to rent a car. So in fact nothing to complain about.\r\nHelen: So keep it up!",

        "Melanie: You mentioned this chutney with green tomatoes yesterday. Have you got a recipe? Have you ever prepared it?\r\nTracy: Hi Melanie! It was delicious. We had with venison at my daughter's. No, I've never prepared myself, she did. Amelia.\r\nMelanie: Do you think she'd share the recipe?\r\nTracy: Oh I'm sure she will. She'll be proud to. Shall I ask?\r\nMelanie: Please do! I'd appreciate it.\r\nTracy: Hi Melanie, just talked with Amelia. She said the green tomato chutney is just like any other chutney, only you add green tomatoes. That's it.\r\nMelanie: How about proportions? How much tomatoes and how much onion and other ingredients?\r\nTracy: I think she said tomatoes come instead of 1/4 of apples.\r\nMelanie: So it's not only tomatoes?\r\nTracy: Of course not. It would be just bitter. I think.\r\nMelanie: Do I have then to pre-prepared the tomatoes? I suppose they're quite bitter when green.\r\nTracy: You're right. I'll ask her.\r\nMelanie: Maybe she's got a recipe written down or something?\r\nTracy: Sorry for not answering at once! So busy now. So I asked Amelia about green tomatoes for chutney and she said she didn't as you say pre-prepare them. But they are always her own tomatoes, from the garden, and she has these sweet cherry tomatoes.\r\nMelanie: A! That makes a whole lot of difference! So I'm afraid I can't imitate her recipe :(\r\nTracy: She's send me a link to BBCFood. They have wonderful things there. I'll forward it to you.\r\nTracy: <file_link> Green Tomato Apple Chutney.\r\nTracy: But look! They have tomatoes and apples half and half. Different than Amelia's. But I'm sure it'll be good as well.\r\nMelanie: Thanks a lot. I'll have a look at it.\r\nMelanie: One more small thing: does Amelia take lemon and orange zest??\r\nTracy: I don't think so. No. I would've tasted that. No, definitely not.\r\nMelanie: Great thanks Tracy! Off to the kitchen then!\r\nTracy: Good luck!",

My dog used to do that to. I did some research on the topic and found this guide <file_other>, I found it very helpful.\r\nLogan: Thank you Annie :)\r\nVince: The most important thing is reinforcement - you verbally punish your dog (never hit him tho) and reward the times when he starts tearing the pillows but listens to you when you tell him to stop. Be careful tho, he might start playing with them just to stop later and get a treat or something - reward the times when he's near the pillow in a playful mood and doesn't touch them. And most importantly - get him some toys. He might just need something to play with.\r\nLogan: Yeah, I got him several toys, but they might not be enough.\r\nVince: Maybe something more pillow-like?
