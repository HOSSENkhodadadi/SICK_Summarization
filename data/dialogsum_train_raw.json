The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams.

But you don't need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: What about the salaries?\n#Person1#: Well, the Pistoia job pays much better in the short term. I'll be getting the equivalent of about 22,000 pounds a year there, but only 20,000 pounds at the Polytechnic. But then the hours are different. At the Polytechnic I'd have to do 35 hours a week, 20 teaching and 15 administration, whereas the Pistoia school is only asking for 30 hours teaching.\n#Person2#: Mmm...\n#Person1#: Then the type of teaching is so different. The Polytechnic is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates. The Language School wants me to do a bit of exam preparation, but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories, and a couple of children's classes. Oh, and a bit of literature teaching.\n#Person2#: Well, that sounds much more varied and interesting. And I'd imagine you'd be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school, and moving around quite a bit.\n#Person1#: Yes, whereas with the Polytechnic position, I'd be stuck in the school all day.",

Times are changing, and having a credit card helps you build a credit rating, control spending, and even buy things that you can't pay with cash ... like the plane ticket I got recently.\n#Person1#: What plane ticket?\n#Person2#: Oh yeah, my roommate and I are going to Hawaii over the school break, and course, I needed some new clothes for that so ...\n#Person1#: I don't want to hear it. How does having a student credit card control spending? It sounds you've spent yourself in a hole. Anyway, student credit cards just lead to impulse spending ... as I can see here. And the interest rates of student credit cards are usually sky-high, and if you miss a payment, the rates, well, just jump!\n#Person2#: Ah. The credit card has a credit limit ...\n#Person1#: ... of $20,000?\n#Person2#: No, no quite that high. Anyway, ...\n#Person1#: I've heard enough.\n#Person2#: Did I tell you we now get digital cable with over 100 channels? Oh, and here's your birthday present. A new MP3 player ...\n#Person1#: Yeah. Oh, don't tell me. Charged on the credit card. Listen. Hey, I don't think having a student credit card is a bad idea, but this is ridiculous. And how in the world are you going to pay off your credit card bill?\n#Person2#: Um, with my birthday money? It's coming up in a week.\n#Person1#: Hey, let's sit down and talk about how you're going to pay things back, and maybe we can come up with a budget that will help you get out of this mess. That's the least I can do.",

It's nice to meet you.\n#Person2#: Well, thank you.\n#Person1#: To begin with, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?\n#Person2#: Okay. Um, yeah. I've always been interested in teaching in a language program like this, and uh, I graduated with a degree in English and psychology eight years ago, [ Oh, really, both? ]. Yeah, and uh then I landed my first job overseas in Japan.\n#Person1#: Oh, wow. That's pretty impressive. What did you do there? What kind of work?\n#Person2#: Well, I worked full time, um, for a private language school in Tokyo for the first two years, and then I found a job at a community college.\n#Person1#: Oh really? So, exactly what did you do in your work there then?\n#Person2#: Well, I taught English and, uh, culinary arts.\n#Person1#: You taught cooking classes?\n#Person2#: Well, well, I know it sounds like an unusual combination, but I completed a program in culinary arts before I got my, uh, English and psychology degrees.\n#Person1#: Oh, Wow. You've done a lot, haven't you? [ Yeah. ] So, what exactly, um, how did you teach and what exactly did you do?\n#Person2#: Well, um, many of my students wanted to become chefs in restaurants, or they wanted to start their own restaurants, uh, and in our area, there were many, uh, tourists tourist spots. A lot of tourists came to that particular area, and so with English, they would be able to communicate not only with suppliers, you know things that they need for restaurant's food and so forth, but also with their customers, and so I taught them English and cooking at the same time.\n#Person1#: Wow. That's, that's pretty impressive. That's interesting. [ ... and tasty. ] Oh, I bet. So, why did you return to the United States? How long have you been back?\n#Person2#: I've been back for, uh, probably about a year now.\n#Person1#: Okay, so what brought you back then?\n#Person2#: Well, one of my former students opened a sushi restaurant, uh, in town, and he asked me to work with him.\n#Person1#: Really? What's the name of the restaurant?\n#Person2#: Well, it's called Flying Sushi. Have you ever heard of it?\n#Person1#: Yes, I've been there. Their food is fabulous; it's top-notch. It's really hard just to get a reservation there.\n#Person2#: I know, and uh, well, I work there two weeknights, and uh, and then ...\n#Person1#: So, two nights a week you're working there still?\n#Person2#: Right, right, but then, but ... I want to return to teaching. I've also been working as a therapist at a treatment center for teenagers struggling with depression and other mental health disorders.\n#Person1#: Oh, wow, that would be a really interesting job.\n#Person2#: It is, it is.\n#Person1#: Wow. You have such a wide range of experience. Uh, you know, to be honest, we have fifteen people who are applying for this position. You've got quite a background, but why don't you tell me three reasons why you would be the best person for this job.\n#Person2#: Um, well, first of all, uh, I understand that different students have different learning styles, and for that reason, I have used iPads, video, music, cooking, drama, role plays, and games to reach every student. [ That's good. ] And second, I have a background in academic and psychological counseling and advising [ Uh, huh ] ... skills that are often needed, you know, in working with international students.\n#Person1#: Yeah, that could be really useful.\n#Person2#: Yeah, so you know, many of them struggle with, uh, emotional turmoil, you know, home sickness ....\n#Person1#: Yeah, coming to a new place ...\n#Person2#: Right, so making the transition can be very overwhelming, and uh ...\n#Person1#: Good. So, what would you say would be a third reason?\n#Person2#: And finally, I speak four different languages ....\n#Person1#: Four? Wow! What languages do you speak?\n#Person2#: Well, I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese at an advanced level. [ At an advanced level? Wow. ] And I also speak Arabic at a high-intermediate level.\n#Person1#: That's very, very impressive. You do have an impressive resume.\n#Person2#: Thank you.\n#Person1#: Uh, what we're doing ... we're going to have two rounds of interviews, and we will contact you on Friday and let you know whether or not you'll be coming back for the second round of interviews.\n#Person2#: Okay.\n#Person1#: It's been really nice meeting you, and thank you for your time.",

It is an excellent film for teachers to show their classes to explain global warming. It explains the facts very well, explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media, and is also pretty funny at times. The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already. This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this, and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together. I think it is a good film, but it is not perfect. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time. I was watching this to find out about global warming, not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election. I imagine that these are the bits that teachers' will have to skip when they show this to their classes, since they don't really add anything to the film. I would have respected Al Gore a bit more if he hadn't tried to make this a film about himself as well.",

We've only got four days in Hong Kong, remember.\n#Person2#: Oh right, well, in that case, I'd advise you to get there early. It opens at 10 o'clock in the morning on weekdays. Look, I think I've got a plan of the place somewhere. Let me see.., yes, here we are. You can have this.\n#Person1#: Thanks.\n#Person2#: OK I'll show you. Let's start with the lower level. See? Here? You arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here, on the right, can you see? That's the bus terminal. And you go in through the main entrance. You could go to Water World first but I think you'd better miss that out as you're short of time, you said. You see the cable cars? Well, those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level. Well, walk past the cable car terminal, at the bottom of the plan, and bear right past the Waterfall Gardens. Actually, have a look in, there are ducks and other birds in the pool there-it's very pretty. Then you'll see some steps up on the left. Follow that path and you'll come to the Centenary Garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you've got your camera. Then carry on until you're almost at the Children's Zoo. Right. I wouldn't bother to visit the zoo if I were you, it takes quite a long time to walk round. But I do recommend the 'Touch and Feed' section opposite, as I said. It's great fun for small children.\n#Person1#: Ok, so we'll pay a visit there, and then what?\n#Person2#: You could come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden. Oh, that's lovely-do wander around if there's time. Then go down the steps to the Otter Pool-you can have a sit down there for a little while and watch the otters messing around in the water. Then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level. The journey takes about ten minutes, I suppose, it's quite a long way. Now if you look at the other plan, the one for the upper level, you'll see where you arrive.\n#Person1#: Is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. The fun fair is in the top left hand corner. Can you see? With 'The Dragon' I was telling you about, and 'The Octopus' and 'The Spider'. Do you think you'll want to go to that?\n#Person1#: Um, well, I think the children are a bit too young really, but they might enjoy watching other people.\n#Person2#: OK. Well, if you're feeling quite hungry by the time you arrive, which you probably will be, why not have a snack in the Chinese Restaurant next to the terminal? When you've finished your lunch, I would go to the Coral Reef first. It's that little building on the left hand side. 'That's where you can see fish and other underwater creatures in a kind of natural habitat.\n#Person1#: Right. That sounds interesting.\n#Person2#: It's lovely. After that, walk up to 'The Dragon' and watch people being really scared! Then you could come down to the Ocean Theater, which is just to the left of the center of the plan- and see a performance of dolphins or maybe the killer whale. You'll have to check the times for that. There's one at two o'clock, I think. I'm not sure about the high diving, but you may be able to see that as well. If there's time, you could also carry on to the fight and have a look at Wave Cove. And finally, if you're not too exhausted by then you could return to the lower level by using the famous escalator. You'd be finished by 3:30 or 4 at the latest.\n#Person1#: Right, well, thanks for all your advice. Urn, we'll send you a postcard!\n#Person2#: I'll look forward to it.",

Being an English teacher in China, I, of course, do not have to pass the IELTS.\n#Person1#: Finally we want to introduce Mr. Yuan, who is financing his studies out of his own pocket. He wants to graduate in Oxford.\n#Person3#: Neither the Chinese nor the British government is financially supporting me. My parents paid me the flight from Beijing to London. In Britain I have relatives that came to Dover via Hong Kong about ten years ago. They give me 500 pounds each month. That is of course not enough to survive. So I get a part-time job in a Chinese restaurant and earn about 400 or 500 pounds per month. I also had to pass the IELTS in order to study at a British University.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr. Yuan. Wang, Zhu, Dong and Yuan, four different people and their different ways of financing their studies in Great Britain. In our next edition of Overseas Students at British Universities we will talk about students from the Far East. Until then. Goodbye.",

What would you like to know?\n#Person2#: First of all, how big is it?\n#Person1#: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer.\n#Person2#: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex?\n#Person1#: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure.\n#Person2#: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all?\n#Person1#: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher.\n#Person2#: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent?\n#Person1#: It's $950 a month.\n#Person2#: Whoa. That is a little steep for me.\n#Person1#: But you could always split the cost with a roommate.\n#Person2#: Perhaps. Does that include utilities?\n#Person1#: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door.\n#Person2#: Water pump!\n#Person1#: Yeah.\n#Person2#: Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time?\n#Person1#: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit.\n#Person2#: Oh, and how much is the deposit?\n#Person1#: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of.\n#Person2#: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in.\n#Person1#: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back.\n#Person2#: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus?\n#Person1#: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front.\n#Person2#: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy?\n#Person1#: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine.\n#Person2#: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants?\n#Person1#: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year.\n#Person2#: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning?\n#Person1#: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then.\n#Person2#: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located?\n#Person1#: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant.\n#Person2#: Ah .... Are pets allowed?\n#Person1#: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that.\n#Person2#: Um, I have a rat ...\n#Person1#: You don't have anything like that, do you?\n#Person2#: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage.

Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet?\n#Person1#: I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars, but they have looked at various designs.\n#Person2#: One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it. What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm not really an expert in this area, but my understanding is that anything is possible. It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4. 5 billion years ago.\n#Person2#: But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans.\n#Person1#: I'm skeptical. Mars is made of rocks containing silicon, iron, and various minerals. It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. It is so different from what we have on earth, you know.\n#Person2#: I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there.\n#Person1#: But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness, food storage, and a series of physiological effects.",

Most of the time, when they travel, they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide, who usually takes care of everything, for instance, choosing the restaurants, the itinerary, the mode of transport, and things like that. Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged, around 40 to 50 or so. This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels, and have money to spend. They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer. They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything.\n#Person2#: I don't mean to interrupt, but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market?\n#Person1#: Just a moment.

So what's next?\n#Person1#: Well, our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines.
