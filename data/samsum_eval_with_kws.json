        "Kyle: Who wants to go out for a drink?\r\nMegan: No, sorry, I'm cleaning the house today.\r\nRoseanne: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen.\r\nVince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away.\r\nKyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.\r\nMegan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P\r\nRoseanne: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty.\r\nVince: What's the difference?\r\nRoseanne: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. I like to have everything within my reach.\r\nVince: There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? XD\r\nKyle: I prefer the floor. There's more space on it :D\r\nMegan: Just reading this gives me the creeps.\r\nKyle: Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a beer :D\r\nRoseanne: Hey, I never said I can come. My hubby's away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;(\r\nVince: Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D\r\nMegan: You know what? I don't care. I can watch your kids, Roseanne. Just bring them over.\r\nRoseanne: But are you serious or just mad at us?\r\nMegan: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D\r\nRoseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.\r\nVince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D\r\nRoseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.\r\nKyle: Do they pay him? :P\r\nRoseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?\r\nMegan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.\r\nRoseanne: The famous chocolate cookies?\r\nMegan: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D\r\nRoseanne: Guys, I think I'm gonna change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper? :D\r\nMegan: You're always welcome! But sorry boys, it's going to be a \u201cgirls only\u201d event (except for little Billy). Otherwise my house will never get cleaned today :D",

Family responsibilities and all that.\r\nGeorge: I understand but it would be good if she let you out now and again to have a few beers with your mates.\r\nJohn: Yeah it would.\r\nGeorge: How is the family life going?\r\nJohn: Could be better.\r\nGeorge: Meaning...?\r\nJohn: Missus wants me to spend more time with the kids and to spend time with her. It's either one or the other since I can't see how I can do both.\r\nJohn: So we end up fighting the whole time.\r\nJohn: Thought that this is family time thing is supposed to be fun instead it is stressful and annoying.\r\nJohn: Sometimes I think that I'm not cut out for the family life.\r\nGeorge: Sounds like you're not really enjoying it. I can fully relate. This is why I stay single and made sure to get the snip.\r\nJohn: Don't get me wrong I DO love my kids but all the extra pressure from the wife doesn't help. She doesn't know what she bloody wants. \r\nJohn: Whatever I do is not good enough. Can't win. Ugh!\r\nGeorge: Women! I could never work them out! \r\nJohn: I thought I could but now I'm not so sure.\r\nGeorge: Maybe a break on Friday night might be a good idea. Help you to clear your head.\r\nJohn: Yeah, I think you're right... I'll think about it.\r\nGeorge: Right-O! Let me know when you decide. Hopefully catch up with you on Friday night.",

And all I do is iron them!\r\nLynn: Can't he do it himself?\r\nJody: Wouldn't even let him near an iron!\r\nLynn: Why not?\r\nJody: Well, mostly because the last time he did ironing, he burnt my favourite shirt and two of his own.\r\nLynn: How did he manage to do that?\r\nJody: Have no idea. Suppose he left the iron on the shirts and forgot to unplug it, but will never know. \r\nLynn: Have you tried an ironing machine?\r\nJody: Yes, I have an iron at home.
